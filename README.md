This repository is made to gather all publicly available "Meditation-EEG datasets" .If you find any extra datasets , or any related links , you can update the repository

### 1) [BIDS formatted EEG meditation experiment data](https://zenodo.org/records/2536267):
This meditation experiment contains 24 subjects. Subjects were meditating and were interrupted about every 2 minutes to indicate their level of concentration and mind wandering. The scientific article (see Reference file) contains all methodological details.

### 2) [EEG Data Acquisition Using the Muse Device: Meditation and Rest Stages of Participants](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/eeg-data-acquisition-using-muse-device-meditation-and-rest-stages-participants#files) : 
This is a study aimed to investigate electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns during meditation to gain insights into the distinctions among practitioners with differing levels of experience.Here they analyzed EEG data from a cohort of seven participants with a unique background in Vipassana meditation, in order to discern how disparities in experience levels manifest in their neural activity. 

Participants were categorized into three groups based on their meditation experience: novices with less than 500 hours of meditation practice, experienced practitioners with over 500 hours of practice who meditated regularly on a daily basis, and monks who had been ordained for a minimum of 10 years and adhered to rigorous meditation routines.

### 3) [EEG Alpha Waves dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/2348892)
This dataset contains electroencephalographic recordings of subjects in a simple resting-state eyes open/closed experimental protocol. Data were recorded during a pilot experiment taking place in the GIPSA-lab, Grenoble, France, in 2017

### 4)[Meditation vs thinking task](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003969/versions/1.0.0):
A total of 98 participants sat either on a blanket on the floor or on a chair for both experimental periods depending on their personal preference. Participants were asked to keep their eyes closed, and all lighting in the room was turned off during data collection. An intercom allowed communication between the experimental and the recording room.
Participants performed four blocks, 2 meditation blocks interspaced by two thining blocks (in which they are instructed to think actively). Half of the participants start with a meditation block, and half of them start with a thinking block. The first meditation block is a breath counting meditation for all participants. The second block is a tradition-specific meditation - except for the control group, for which it is a breath counting meditation.
